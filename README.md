The purpose of this project is to build a basic recipe website and to practice all of the HTML knowledge that I've learned so far. 

I'm following along in https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes.

Lessons I'll be learning:

using git/github and terminal in linux. Practicing commits. 
using html to use tags and elements and to create lists.
